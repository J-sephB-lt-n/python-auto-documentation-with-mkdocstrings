# Auto-Generated Python Project Documentation with MkDocs

This repo is my investigation of automatic python project documentation using [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs), [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings) and [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). The code is then hosted on GitHub pages, with automatic deployment using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). 

At the moment, most of the code in this repo is copied and pasted from [this real python tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/). 

You can browse the static build of the documentation here: https://J-sephB-lt-n.github.io/python-auto-documentation-with-mkdocstrings/dfsdf
